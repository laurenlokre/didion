John asked that question.
A perfectly healthy young woman.
Married five months. 
She and Gerry had just had their first Thanksgiving dinner. 
They pureed turnips, they unpacked their wedding china.</div>

I was on Fire Island when I first made that sauerkraut, and it was raining, and we drank a lot of bourbon and ate the sauerkraut and went to bed at ten, and I listened to the rain and the Atlantic and felt safe. I made the sauerkraut again last night and it did not make me feel any safer, but that is, as they say, another story.</div>
